# What's new in Navigator

This page summarizes recent improvements that affect how you work in Navigator. For step-by-step instructions, follow the links in each section. For the full version history, see the [Changelog](/changelog).

## New this release

- **Much faster document ingestion** - Navigator reads text pages with a fast text extractor and runs the heavy layout model only on pages with tables. A text-heavy protocol ingests several times faster (up to about 11 times faster on a mostly-text document). See [Upload documents](/collections/upload-documents).
- **Live page-by-page upload progress** - uploading a document, creating a collection, and amending a document now show real per-page progress and elapsed time, not a spinner that looks stuck on a large PDF.
- **Type-to-search the study collection switcher** - start typing to filter the collection list instead of scrolling.
- **See the full sponsor name in the study collection switcher** - the switcher now grows to fit its text, so long protocol and sponsor names show in full instead of clipping.
- **More reliable chat** - an answer appears in your conversation even if the live connection drops during the reply, and a rare "no answer" case now recovers the answer or explains a provider outage.
- **Correct Insights totals** - Total Queries, Time Saved, and Self-Service rate now match the per-site numbers in the same view.
- **Faster start** - Navigator starts quicker after an idle period, and the study collection list loads faster.

## Smarter chat

- **Follow-up questions** - Navigator keeps context from your recent messages in the same conversation, so short follow-ups (for example *"What about Visit 2?"*) work without repeating the full question.
- **Regulatory references** - Answers can cite governance and regulatory sources alongside your study documents. Look for regulatory badges in the text and in **View sources**.
- **View Flow** - On completed answers, open **View Flow** to see how Navigator approached your question (helpful for complex or multi-step responses).

## Documents and collections

- **More file types** - Upload PDFs, Microsoft Office files (Word, PowerPoint, Excel), CSV, HTML, Markdown, and common images - not only PDF. See [Upload documents](/collections/upload-documents).
- **Rename collections** - Site administrators can rename a study collection's Protocol ID and sponsor name from **Manage → Collection Settings**.
- **Access control** - Site administrators can limit who sees a whole collection or individual documents. See [Restrict collection and document access](/collections/restrict-access).

## Visits

- **Source Quality Control** - Upload scanned or photographed source documents for a study and Navigator reviews them against ALCOA data-quality dimensions (attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate), flagging missing signatures or required fields. Coordinators can record comments and resolution status on each finding.

## Artifacts

- **Flexible sharing** - Share saved answers privately, with **specific people** at your site, or with **everyone at this site**.
- **Scoped to your collection** - Artifacts always shows the active study collection's saved answers, in sync with the sidebar collection picker.

## Administration

- **Collection access** - Site administrators manage who can use a study collection, or specific documents in it, from **Manage → Collection Settings** on each collection. See [Restrict collection and document access](/collections/restrict-access).
- **Insights** - Usage analytics and optional **LLM Subtopic Analysis** help site and sponsor administrators understand how teams use Navigator.
- **Site capacity** - Site administrators can track usage against user, document, and collection limits, and invite new teammates directly by magic link without a platform administrator. See [Users & site capacity](/admin/site-capacity-and-users).

## Sign-in and reliability

- **Session timeout** - After 60 minutes of inactivity you are signed out for security; sign in again from the login page.
- **Clearer session messages** - If your session ends, the login page explains why so you are not left on a blank screen.
- **Two-factor authentication** - Administrator and medical monitor accounts require an authenticator app code at sign-in, with a countdown shown if you're temporarily locked out after repeated failed attempts. See [Two-factor authentication (MFA)](/settings/multi-factor-authentication).
